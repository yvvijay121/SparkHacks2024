SpakHacks 2024 project with Yash Vijay, Trenton Coleman, Aditya Dalal and Rohith Komati 

## Inspiration
We were inspired by pharmaceutical and medical apps such as VCS and Medisafe, but we felt that we could create some small improvements to the overall UI and 
## What it does
AegisRx is a drug tracking app that schedules and reminds users of what prescriptions they need to take and provides notifications if they are overtaking or undertaking certain drugs.
## How we built it
AegisRx was first implemented through a wireframe design on Figma. Yash and Aditya mainly programmed our project while other members drew how the scheduling would look in a web interface. 
## Challenges we ran into
We wanted to add SMS and email notifications along with text-to-speech functionality to appeal to geriatric users, but due to time constraints, we were unable to implement this.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud of your UI and our user login functionality. This made our project pop out more visually which as we consistently revised our UI was very helpful.
## What we learned
We learned full-stack development and how to interact with SQLite databases in JavaScript and Python. Additionally, we learned responsive web design and UI.
## What's next for AegisRx Drug Tracker Web Application
In the future, we look to finish our app in hopes of developing a fully functioning drug database search engine.
